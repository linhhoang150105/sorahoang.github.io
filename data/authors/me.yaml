Hi there, I'm Sora! 👋

I am currently a third-year student majoring in **International Business** at **Foreign Trade University (FTU)**.

Formerly an active member of the **ECOM Club**, where I developed a keen interest in E-commerce and digital business strategies.

Beyond academics, I describe myself as an avid reader 📚 and a travel enthusiast ✈️ who loves exploring new cultures and perspectives.
